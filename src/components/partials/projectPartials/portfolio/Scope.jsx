                    <p>Although we had only touched on a small portion of the potential of the library durring the "Javascript Frameworks" module, it was React's versatility which hooked my interest from the beginning. Unlike Wordpress, React is used to create Web Applications allowing it to be rendered as an app. You can see it work it's magic on apps such as Discord, Slack, and Netflix to name a few which all can be accessed via Web Browser or an individual Application.</p>
                    <p>The objective of the site was to challange myself and my understanding of the React Framework by creating a site using it's base features. As mentioned before this is NOT at all the correct way this framework is to be used, infact React may be "overkill" if one where to use it this way.</p>
